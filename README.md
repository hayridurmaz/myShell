# myShell
Hello World!
This is a brand new shell for Linux. It has capability to execute commands threaded.
Usage:
Shell has 2 options of mode; 1. interactive mode or 2. batch mode. If you execute ./myShell without any argumants, program will start in interactive mode.
Otherwise, you can add an argument of batch file path and name! like: ./myShell /batch/fie/path/and/name.txt
If commands are splited by | , they will be executed sequentally. If commands are splited by ';', those will be executed threaded.
